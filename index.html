          Where I started to how I arrived here... I have managed a large retail
          store for the last 19 years with 140+ employees. During that time I
          increased the net income 860%. While the work was rewarding, the pay
          was very good, it didn't allow for enough family time which is very
          important to me.

          I have always had interest in computers and growing up I was taught by
          my aunt how to physically build pcs starting with my first processor
          speed of a 256 MHz. I also learned the DOS commands to navigate the
          C:/ prompt. Later, I went to college for web design and networking but
          never got a job in that field. I'm currently enrolled at University of
          Oregon's coding bootcamp and enjoying their learning platform. I am
          also enrolled in a secondary school (Frontend Masters) to also grow my
          coding profile. Hopefully between the two I can find a position that
          is both challenging and that allows for a positive home life.

          When I'm not at school, I enjoy spending time with my wife and three
          boys. We love the many outdoor activities that our PNW has to offer
          including hiking, skiing, and fishing.
